# Off-white Dunk Tracker

There are 50 offwhite dunk lows, called "lots" that are basically the same shoe with different colored accents.

They are each sold as seperate products on stockx, so there is no good way to track the lowest price of all the lots combined.
That is the problem this app solves.

## Deployment
Lambda?
Probably make it a subdomain of my brendanbeck.com
